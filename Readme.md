============

This is a prototype of Operating System. Based on PepinOS tutorials for the first steps.


Requirements: 
=============

Ubuntu
------

`sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386`

Objectives

- Continuous-Integration with Travis-CI (expects the OS to be stored in an iso, and it's the problem: first try with grub2 failed. A test with LILO may be done).
